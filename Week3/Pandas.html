                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China.</p> <p>It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.</p> <p>The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda.</p> <p>Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.</p> <p>Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion.</p> <p>In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>

<p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighbouring provinces, namely Shaanxi and Gansu.</p> <p>As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.</p>

<p>The giant panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.</p>
