                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
<p>The gemsbok or gemsbuck (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the Oryx genus.</p> <p>It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert.</p> <p>Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.</p>

<p>The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia, where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.</p>

<p>The name "gemsbok" in English is derived from Afrikaans gemsbok, which itself is derived from the Dutch name of the male chamois, gemsbok.</p> <p>Although some superficial similarities in appearance (especially in the facial pattern) are noticed, the chamois and the oryx are not closely related.</p>
                    <br>
<h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>

<p>You will find the gemsboks just beyond panda canyon.</p>
